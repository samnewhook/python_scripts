# Python Scripts

## updatetodo.py
A script for keeping an up to date record of my todo lists from day to day on WSL
## Getting Started
1. Install Pathogen following the instructions from https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
2. Using Pathogen, install the vim todo plugin from https://github.com/aserebryakov/vim-todo-lists
3. Create a directory for python scripts. Mine is ```~/.local/bin/python_scripts```
4. Add to your .bashrc or  .zshrc the line export ```PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/.local/bin/python_scripts```
### TODO
1. Test initialization of todolist script directory (what happens if no files found?)
2. Remove personal directory structure and pass in directory location
